This web app saves time by allowing users to generate a customized file and folder structure for their new projects. 
Instead of manually creating each directory and file, you can simply input a tree like text structure, and the app will create it for you.

Features
- Text-based Input: Easily define your project's file and folder hierarchy using a simple, intuitive tree format.
- Local Generation: Creates the full project structure directly in a specified directory on your computer.
- Python-based: Built with the lightweight Flask framework.
